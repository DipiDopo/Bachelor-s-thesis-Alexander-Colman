# Bachelor's thesis Alexander Colman
The files uploaded here are part of a Bachelor's thesis implementing the Simplex method, column generation and Branch-and-Bound algorithms. This work was done for the title Bachelor of Science (Physics) at the University of Antwerp.

There are three main Python files to be found; implementation.py, runner.py and research.py. The first two are for running the Simplex method, column generation and Branch-and-Bound algorithms: implementation.py contains a class ColumnGeneration, which can be used to calculate the optimal solution in an LP containing costs, times and optional constraints. runner.py contains commented code, which, if uncommented, runs the ColumnGeneration class for specific cases. The third Python file contains the code that was used to research the computation time of three different branching tactics.
For more information about each of these files, please read their respective READMEs.
